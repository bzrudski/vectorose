  abstract = {Abstract             Coordinated cardiomyocyte contraction drives the mammalian heart to beat and circulate blood. No consensus model of cardiomyocyte geometrical arrangement exists, due to the limited spatial resolution of whole heart imaging methods and the piecemeal nature of studies based on histological sections. By combining microscopy and computer vision, we produced the first-ever three-dimensional cardiomyocyte orientation reconstruction across mouse ventricular walls at the micrometer scale, representing a gain of three orders of magnitude in spatial resolution. We recovered a cardiomyocyte arrangement aligned to the long-axis direction of the outer ventricular walls. This cellular network lies in a thin shell and forms a continuum with longitudinally arranged cardiomyocytes in the inner walls, with a complex geometry at the apex. Our reconstruction methods can be applied at fine spatial scales to further understanding of heart wall electrical function and mechanics, and set the stage for the study of micron-scale fiber remodeling in heart disease.           ,              Synopsis                                                                image                                                                         Recovering cardiomyocyte geometry at the cellular scale is of fundamental interest, given the role this organization plays in driving heart wall electrical conduction and mechanics. Confocal microscopy with computer vision methods allow micrometer-scale reconstruction of cardiomyocyte orientation.                                                   Tissue clearing, volumetric imaging using confocal microscopy, and computer vision methods reveal cardiomyocyte orientation in intact sections spanning the entire mouse heart.                                                     Direct estimation of cardiomyocyte orientation is obtained at a finer spatial resolution than that resolved by conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

  abstract = {Abstract                            Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Separate analyses of wind velocity and direction are made with vector-based PCA, and the scalar (zonal and meridional) components of wind are described using a scalar-based PCA. Comparisons indicate that results of the three PCAs are not equivalent. Vector PCA yields the most physically comprehensive components because the velocity observations are not decomposed into direction and speed, or into zonal and meridional coordinates               a priori.               Directional and scalar-based PCAs appear similar but since they only summarize one coordinate of velocity at a time, they represent incomplete descriptions of the wind field. Vector-based PCA then is the most appropriate of the three for investigating wind fields or other vector-valued data sets.},

  abstract = {Cardiac fibers, as well as their local arrangement in laminar sheets, have a complex spatial variation of their orientation that has an important role in mechanical and electrical cardiac functions. In this paper, a statistical atlas of this cardiac fiber architecture is built for the first time using human datasets. This atlas provides an average description of the human cardiac fiber architecture along with its variability within the population. In this study, the population is composed of ten healthy human hearts whose cardiac fiber architecture is imaged ex vivo with DT-MRI acquisitions. The atlas construction is based on a computational framework that minimizes user interactions and combines most recent advances in image analysis: graph cuts for segmentation, symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic demons for registration, and log-Euclidean metric for diffusion tensor processing and statistical analysis. Results show that the helix angle of the average fiber orientation is highly correlated to the transmural depth and ranges from-41 on the epicardium to +66 on the endocardium. Moreover, we find that the fiber orientation dispersion across the population (13) is lower than for the laminar sheets (31). This study, based on human hearts, extends previous studies on other mammals with concurring conclusions and provides a description of the cardiac fiber architecture more specific to human and better suited for clinical applications. Indeed, this statistical atlas can help to improve the computational models used for radio-frequency ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, surgical ventricular restoration, or diagnosis and followups of heart diseases due to fiber architecture anomalies.  2012 IEEE.}

The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of               marching cubes               .

Conventional methods are based on the orientation of interface elements. The results of these methods do not always agree with perceived anisotropy, and anisotropic structures do not necessarily turn out to be `anisotropic' using these methods. In the present paper, we propose an alternative to curve and surface orientation, namely volume orientation. Using trabecular bone as an example of a two-phase anisotropic structure, the new concept is studied in some detail. In particular, a parametric method of estimating volume orientation from sections is presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Cancellous bone architecture and mechanics are intimately related. The trabecular architecture of cancellous bone is considered determined by its mechanical environment (Wolff's law), and the mechanical properties of cancellous bone are inversely determined by the trabecular architecture and material properties. Much effort has been spent in expressing these relations, but the techniques and variables necessary for this have not been fully identified. it is obvious, however, that some measure of architectural anisotropy (fabric) is needed. Within the last few years, volume-based measures of fabric have been introduced as alternatives to the mean intercept length method, which has some theoretical problems. This paper seeks to answer which of four different fabric measures best predicts finite element calculated mechanical anisotropy directions. Twenty-nine cancellous bone specimens were three-dimensionally reconstructed using the automated serial sectioning technique. A series of large-scale finite-element analyses were performed on each of the three-dimensional reconstructions to calculate the compliance matrix for each specimen, from which the mechanical principal directions were derived. The architcctural anisotropy was determined in three-dimensional space for each specimen using mean intercept length (MIL), volume orientation (VO), star volume distribution (SVD) and star length distribution (SLD). Each of the architectural anisotropy results were expressed by a fabric tensor. Architectural main directions were determined from the fabric tensors and compared with the FE-calculated mechanical anisotropy directions. All architectural measures predicted the mechanical main directions rather well, which supports the assumption that mechanical anisotropy directions are aligned with fabric directions. MIL showed a significant, though very small (1.4{$^\circ$}), deviation from the primary mechanical direction. VO had difficulty in determining secondary and tertiary mechanical directions; its mcan deviation was 8.9{$^\circ$}. SVD and SLD provided marginally better predictors of mechanical anisotropy directions than MIL and VO.}

  abstract = {Biomineralization research examines structure-function relations in all types of exo- and endo-skeletons and other hard tissues of living organisms, and it relies heavily on 3D imaging. Segmentation of 3D renderings of biomineralized structures has long been a bottleneck because of human limitations such as our available time, attention span, eye-hand coordination, cognitive biases, and attainable precision, amongst other limitations. Since recently, some of these routine limitations appear to be surmountable thanks to the development of deep-learning algorithms for biological imagery in general, and for 3D image segmentation in particular. Many components of deep learning often appear too abstract for a life scientist. Despite this, the basic principles underlying deep learning have many easy-to-grasp commonalities with human learning and universal logic. This primer presents these basic principles in what we feel is an intuitive manner, without relying on prerequisite knowledge of informatics and computer science, and with the aim of improving the reader's general literacy in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here, biomineralization case studies are presented to illustrate the application of deep learning for solving segmentation and analysis problems of 3D images ridden by various artifacts, and/or which are plainly difficult to interpret. The presented portfolio of case studies includes three examples of imaging using micro-computed tomography ({\textmu}CT), and three examples using focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), all on mineralized tissues. We believe this primer will expand the circle of users of deep learning amongst biomineralization researchers and other life scientists involved with 3D imaging, and will encourage incorporation of this powerful tool into their professional skillsets and to explore it further.}

  abstract = {Abstract Trabecular bone anisotropy, describing preferential trabecular co-alignment, is a proxy for its long-term loading history. Trabecular anisotropy varies locally, thus rendering averaged calculations across an entire bone inutile. Here we present a 3D trabecular anisotropy mapping method using vector fields where each vector reflects the extent of local co-alignment of the elementary units of surface. 3D anisotropy maps of hundreds of thousands of vectors were visualized by their magnitude and direction. Similarly, volume fraction was mapped as 3D scalar fields. We constructed anisotropy and volume fraction maps using micro-computed tomography of four presumably nonpathologic human calcanei and compared their anisotropy signature with pathologically loaded calcanei in club foot and calcaneonavicular ankylosis. In the nonpathologic calcaneus, a pattern of four anisotropy trajectories (bands) was consistently identified as dorsal, plantar, Achilles', and peroneal bands. Both pathologic specimens deviated from the nonpathologic maps. The calcaneus in the congenitally disused club foot showed very low local anisotropy values, no co-oriented bands, and low volume fraction. The ankylosed calcaneus showed lower anisotropy than the nonpathologic calcaneus, but not to the same extent as the club foot, and showed patchy high volume fraction. The directionality of co-oriented bands was barely discernable in the ankylosed calcaneus as compared to nonpathologic calcaneus. The anisotropy signature of the nonpathologic calcaneus is consistent with a kinetic loading pattern attributable to walking. The loss of this kinetic loading results in an absent/vanishing anisotropy signature. Such 3D mapping adds new dimensions to quantitative bioimaging of bone and the understanding of skeletal adaptation.}

  abstract = {Ontogenetic changes in the human femur associated with the acquisition of bipedal locomotion, especially the development of the bicondylar angle, have been well documented. The purpose of this study is to quantify changes in the three-dimensional structure of trabecular bone in the human proximal femur in relation to changing functional and external loading patterns with age. High-resolution X-ray computed tomography scan data were collected for 15 juvenile femoral specimens ranging in age from prenatal to approximately nine years of age. Serial slices were collected for the entire proximal femur of each individual with voxel resolutions ranging from 0.017 to 0.046mm depending on the size of the specimen. Spherical volumes of interest were defined within the proximal femur, and the bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and fabric anisotropy were calculated in three dimensions. Bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and degree of anisotropy decrease between the age of 6 months and 12 months, with the lowest values for these parameters occurring in individuals near 12 months of age. By age 2--3 years, the bone volume, thickness, and degree of anisotropy increase slightly, and regions in the femoral neck become more anisotropic corresponding to the thickening of the inferior cortical bone of the neck. These results suggest that trabecular structure in the proximal femur reflects the shift in external loading patterns associated with the initiation of unassisted walking in infants.}

We synthesize classical concepts and the recent literature on a wide range of aspects of leaf venation. We describe 10 major structural features that contribute to multiple key functions, and scale up to leaf and plant performance. We describe the development and plasticity of leaf venation and its adaptation across environments globally, and a new global data compilation indicating trends relating vein length per unit area to climate, growth form and habitat worldwide. We synthesize the evolution of vein traits in the major plant lineages throughout paleohistory, highlighting the multiple origins of individual traits. We summarize the strikingly diverse current applications of leaf vein research in multiple fields of science and industry.

Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},

  abstract = {The completion of interrupted lines or the enhancement of flow-like structures is a challenging task in computer vision, human vision, and image processing. We address this problem by presenting a multiscale method in which a nonlinear diffusion filter is steered by the so-called interest operator (second-moment matrix, structure tensor). An m-dimensional formulation of this method is analysed with respect to its well-posedness and scale-space properties. An efficient scheme is presented which uses a stabilization by a semi-implicit additive operator splitting (AOS), and the scale-space behaviour of this method is illustrated by applying it to both 2-D and 3-D images.}
