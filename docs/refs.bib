  abstract = {Abstract             Coordinated cardiomyocyte contraction drives the mammalian heart to beat and circulate blood. No consensus model of cardiomyocyte geometrical arrangement exists, due to the limited spatial resolution of whole heart imaging methods and the piecemeal nature of studies based on histological sections. By combining microscopy and computer vision, we produced the first-ever three-dimensional cardiomyocyte orientation reconstruction across mouse ventricular walls at the micrometer scale, representing a gain of three orders of magnitude in spatial resolution. We recovered a cardiomyocyte arrangement aligned to the long-axis direction of the outer ventricular walls. This cellular network lies in a thin shell and forms a continuum with longitudinally arranged cardiomyocytes in the inner walls, with a complex geometry at the apex. Our reconstruction methods can be applied at fine spatial scales to further understanding of heart wall electrical function and mechanics, and set the stage for the study of micron-scale fiber remodeling in heart disease.           ,              Synopsis                                                                image                                                                         Recovering cardiomyocyte geometry at the cellular scale is of fundamental interest, given the role this organization plays in driving heart wall electrical conduction and mechanics. Confocal microscopy with computer vision methods allow micrometer-scale reconstruction of cardiomyocyte orientation.                                                   Tissue clearing, volumetric imaging using confocal microscopy, and computer vision methods reveal cardiomyocyte orientation in intact sections spanning the entire mouse heart.                                                     Direct estimation of cardiomyocyte orientation is obtained at a finer spatial resolution than that resolved by conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).                                                     Cellular scale reconstruction reveals a complex geometry of smoothly varying aggregate cardiomyocyte orientations in axial, longitudinal, and apical sections of heart ventricles.},

  abstract = {Cardiac fibers, as well as their local arrangement in laminar sheets, have a complex spatial variation of their orientation that has an important role in mechanical and electrical cardiac functions. In this paper, a statistical atlas of this cardiac fiber architecture is built for the first time using human datasets. This atlas provides an average description of the human cardiac fiber architecture along with its variability within the population. In this study, the population is composed of ten healthy human hearts whose cardiac fiber architecture is imaged ex vivo with DT-MRI acquisitions. The atlas construction is based on a computational framework that minimizes user interactions and combines most recent advances in image analysis: graph cuts for segmentation, symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic demons for registration, and log-Euclidean metric for diffusion tensor processing and statistical analysis. Results show that the helix angle of the average fiber orientation is highly correlated to the transmural depth and ranges from-41 on the epicardium to +66 on the endocardium. Moreover, we find that the fiber orientation dispersion across the population (13) is lower than for the laminar sheets (31). This study, based on human hearts, extends previous studies on other mammals with concurring conclusions and provides a description of the cardiac fiber architecture more specific to human and better suited for clinical applications. Indeed, this statistical atlas can help to improve the computational models used for radio-frequency ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, surgical ventricular restoration, or diagnosis and followups of heart diseases due to fiber architecture anomalies.  2012 IEEE.}

  abstract = {Abstract Trabecular bone anisotropy, describing preferential trabecular co-alignment, is a proxy for its long-term loading history. Trabecular anisotropy varies locally, thus rendering averaged calculations across an entire bone inutile. Here we present a 3D trabecular anisotropy mapping method using vector fields where each vector reflects the extent of local co-alignment of the elementary units of surface. 3D anisotropy maps of hundreds of thousands of vectors were visualized by their magnitude and direction. Similarly, volume fraction was mapped as 3D scalar fields. We constructed anisotropy and volume fraction maps using micro-computed tomography of four presumably nonpathologic human calcanei and compared their anisotropy signature with pathologically loaded calcanei in club foot and calcaneonavicular ankylosis. In the nonpathologic calcaneus, a pattern of four anisotropy trajectories (bands) was consistently identified as dorsal, plantar, Achilles', and peroneal bands. Both pathologic specimens deviated from the nonpathologic maps. The calcaneus in the congenitally disused club foot showed very low local anisotropy values, no co-oriented bands, and low volume fraction. The ankylosed calcaneus showed lower anisotropy than the nonpathologic calcaneus, but not to the same extent as the club foot, and showed patchy high volume fraction. The directionality of co-oriented bands was barely discernable in the ankylosed calcaneus as compared to nonpathologic calcaneus. The anisotropy signature of the nonpathologic calcaneus is consistent with a kinetic loading pattern attributable to walking. The loss of this kinetic loading results in an absent/vanishing anisotropy signature. Such 3D mapping adds new dimensions to quantitative bioimaging of bone and the understanding of skeletal adaptation.}
