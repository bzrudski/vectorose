# Users' Guide

Welcome to VectoRose! Our open-source package provides a straightforward
tool for exploring axial and vectorial data in 3D.

This guide presents everything you need to know about how to set up and use
VectoRose. We describe the type of data that VectoRose can analyse, how to
load these data, how the data can be visualised and how the data can be
statistically studied.

We recommend reading this guide in order, as each section builds on the
previous ones. Some pages explain concepts, while other provide longer
worked examples with detailed demonstrations of how to use VectoRose.
