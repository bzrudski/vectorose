    """Construct a spherical histogram.

    Construct a spherical histogram based on the specified vectors. The
    number of points contained in each face will be counted and returned as
    an array, along with the actual sphere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors
        NumPy array containing the 3D vector components in the order
        ``(x, y, z)``. This array should have shape ``(n, 3)`` where ``n``
        is the number of vectors.
    radius
        Radius of the sphere. The vector components are multiplied to
        ensure that they fit the sphere with this radius.
    subdivisions
        Number of subdivisions when constructing the icosphere.
    weight_by_magnitude
        Indicate whether to weight the histogram by 3D magnitude.

    Returns
    -------
    sphere : trimesh.primitives.Sphere
        The sphere on which the histogram is constructed.
    face_counts : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the counts at each face. The order corresponds to
        the order of the faces defined by the mesh.

    """Run the complete triangle-based spherical histogram construction.

    Construct a spherical histogram using a triangle-based mesh. This
    function performs preprocessing, as well as the sphere construction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vector_field
        NumPy array of shape ``(n, 3)`` or ``(n, 6)`` containing the
        vectors to use to construct the histogram. If the array contains 6
        columns, the last 3 are assumed to be the vector components.
    radius
        Sphere radius, by default 1.
    subdivisions
        Sphere subdivision number, by default 3. Increasing this value
        provides more faces, and thus more detail, at a higher
        computational cost.
    weight_by_magnitude
        Indicate whether to weight the histogram by 3D magnitude. If
        `False`, the histogram will be weighted by count.
    is_axial_data
        Indicate whether the data correspond to axial data. If `True`, then
        the sphere will be symmetric across a 45Â° plane going through all
        three axes.

    Returns
    -------
    sphere : trimesh.primitives.Sphere
        The :class:`trimesh.primitives.Sphere` object used to construct the
        histogram.
    face_weights : numpy.ndarray
        Array containing the face weights.
